The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a data set from an observational study conducted in 2013 by the CDC in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The purpose of this study was to retrieve state-specific data on preventative health practices and risk behaviors from approximately 490,000 randomly selected individuals that reside in private residences or college housing. The survey was conducted with stratified random sampling from all participating districts.
